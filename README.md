# Sudoku---Genetic-Algorithms

BI-ZUM
The course provides an introduction to problem solving using artificial intelligence methods with an emphasis on symbolic techniques. The question of intelligent agent design and the sub-techniques needed to create it, especially at the decision-making level, will be discussed. An intelligent agent can be represented, for example, by a physical robot, but also by a non-physical entity such as a virtual assistant or a character in a computer game. For the techniques discussed, we will not only present the basics, but also discuss the current state of knowledge. In the exercises, students will experience how to teach a robot to compose puzzles, how to create a powerful computer counterpart for a turn-based or action game, and how to make decisions in a community of stock exchange agents with different interests. The co-requisite is a concurrent pair of Machine Learning courses. Therefore, machine learning or other non-symbolic artificial intelligence techniques are not covered here.

Sudoku
Consider the well-known SUDOKU completion game, where we have to complete the digits 1 to 9 in a 9x9 grid in such a way that different conditions for the variety of digits are satisfied. We will not describe the rules in detail, we assume they are known. Your task is to solve the completion problem using artificial intelligence techniques, but in such a way that it is done as quickly and guaranteed as possible, i.e. the solving algorithm always finishes and gives the correct solution. 
Formulate SUDOKU as a local search problem.
Try different variants to locally change the candidate solution and compare them.
A 9x9 array is a piece of cake for today's computers (of course, as when), so try a generalized SUDOKU on a larger playing field.
